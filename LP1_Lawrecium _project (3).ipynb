    "#### Startup Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "Startups typically progress through several stages of funding rounds, often referred to as \"series.\" These series are indicative of the company's growth and development. Here are the common types of startup stages or series:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Seed Stage (Pre-Seed, Seed Round):**\n",
    "   - This is the earliest stage of funding where the startup is just getting off the ground.\n",
    "   - Seed funding is used to validate the business idea, develop a prototype, and conduct initial market research.\n",
    "   - Investors at this stage could include friends, family, angel investors, or early-stage venture capital firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Series A:**\n",
    "   - At this stage, the startup has usually developed a product or service and has some initial traction in the market.\n",
    "   - Series A funding is typically used to scale the business operations, expand the team, and further develop the product.\n",
    "   - Venture capital firms are the primary investors in Series A rounds, although some angel investors and early-stage investors may also participate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Series B:**\n",
    "   - By the Series B stage, the startup has demonstrated significant growth potential and has a solid customer base.\n",
    "   - The funding raised in Series B rounds is often used to further scale the business, enter new markets, and invest in marketing and sales efforts.\n",
    "   - Venture capital firms continue to be the main source of funding at this stage, along with some participation from strategic investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Series C and Beyond:**\n",
    "   - These stages represent subsequent rounds of funding as the startup continues to grow and expand.\n",
    "   - Series C, D, E, and so forth rounds may involve larger amounts of funding and can be used for various purposes such as further expansion, acquisitions, or preparing for an initial public offering (IPO).\n",
    "   - At these later stages, the startup may attract investments from larger venture capital firms, private equity firms, hedge funds, or even corporate investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bridge Rounds:**\n",
    "   - In between major funding rounds, startups may sometimes raise bridge rounds to provide additional runway while they prepare for the next significant financing round.\n",
    "   - Bridge rounds are often smaller and may involve existing investors providing additional capital to sustain operations until the next major round.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above knowledge stages / series, we will rename some of the stage values in **all dataframes**"
